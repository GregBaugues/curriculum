# Networking

### Projected Time
30-45 minutes

### Prerequisites
Here are links to lessons that should be completed before this lesson.
- [Git version control](version-control/git-version-control/git-version-control.md)

### Motivation
At some point in our careers, every one of us will need to ask others for feedback, connections, or support. The more you can build and manage your network, the better able you'll be to achieve your goals. With the right strategies, networking can be enjoyable and advantageous. 

### Objectives
**Apprentices will be able to:**
- Have a conversation with approxmimately anyone, and have them feel that it was the best converastion they had all day. 
- Use introductions as a form of currency. 
- Even more things
- Even more things

### Specific Things To Teach
- Set goals for new connections, maybe compete with friends.
- Names should be written as clearly and big as possible on name tags at events to avoid awkward squinting.
- Add pronouns to your name tag if you think that'll make it easier for people.
- Make a second name tag that says, "Ask me about _____."
- Wave at people you know and then either avoid them completely or take them along with you to meet new people.
- When you learn a new name, take the time to really learn it by thinking of someone else with a similar name or something that rhymes with it, etc. No one is really "bad at names."
- [The Pac-Man rule](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)
- Don’t be afraid to walk up to people and introduce yourself to them. They’ll probably be glad you made it easier for them to meet more people.
- If you get stuck in a conversation at a networking event:
	- Stick out your hand and shake the person’s hand or touch their arm while saying, “It was great meeting you.” 
	- Say, “Let’s mingle some more,” and walk away. 
	- Say, “I see someone I need to talk to.”

- How to have a conversation with someone and get them to do 80% of the talking. You'll accomplish this mostly via active listening and asking questions. 

### Materials

- [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0777RJS2J/ref=dp-kindle-redirect). Please forgive the terrible name of this book. It was written in a difference era. Warren Buffet said one of the most important days in his life was when he read this book. It is an easy-to-read manual on human interaction. Conversation, like programming, is a skill. It can be learned. It can be practiced. It can be modeled. This quick read will give you tools and a strategy for having better conversations and building better relationships with people. 
- [Never Eat Alone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H6JBFOS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect). 

### Lesson

Here's text about introducing something and how it works.

Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.

Make sure to mention these things:
- Things
	- This is a sub-thing
- More things
- Even more things

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions

People often assume that in order to have a conversation that the other person finds interesting, that you need to say interesting things. In reality, there is one topic that nearly everyone finds most intersting: themselves. The trick to having conversations that other people find intersting is to give them permission to talk about themselves. There is nothing that you can talk about that will be more intersting to them than that. Ask lots of questions. Ask about how they feel. Give them permission to talk about things that no one else wants to hear about. You can say approximately nothing, you can let the other person talk for 27 minutes in a 30 minute conversation, and they will think that was the most intersting converastion they've had all day. (Hattip to "How to Win Friends and Influence People" for this advice).

### Guided Practice

Have the apprentices work with you as you do something.


### Independent Practice

Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items.


### Challenge

Apprentices can try to do this other thing.


### Check for Understanding

Have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps assess their understanding.
